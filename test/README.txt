To use single.sh and paired.sh test your SWAN installation:

1. download the mock swan_test data package (approximately 603MB) from http://meta.usc.edu/softs/swan/swan_test.tgz 

2. unzip it within this directory and you will see an example directory containing necessary mock data files for successful testing
